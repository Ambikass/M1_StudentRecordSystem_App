   * The educational institution will be able to keep track of all of the students information.
   * You can access student data as an admin user by utilising a unique id number. Students can also access the data at any time.
   * It's password-protected, so no one else can see it.
   
   ##  Weaknesses
   * Less access to teachers and administration by parents.
   * Minor problems and issues.

   ## Opportunities
   * Paperless work. 
   * Automatic updates. 
   * Staff work load reduces.

   ## Threats
   * If the password is easy to crack then there is a chance of loosing the data.
   * If adequate safety precautions are not taken ,the information contained might gain access and get exposed to risks.
